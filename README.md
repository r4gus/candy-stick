## Crypto

### Algorithms

This implementation will support exactly one signature algorithm,
namely [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) 
(Elyptic Curve Digital Signature algorithm) with SHA-256 as defined
by [COSE](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms) (-7).

### Key-Pairs

This project uses a very similar approch to [Solo1](https://github.com/solokeys/solo1/blob/master/docs/fido2-impl.md) to store
key-pairs. Instead of storing every key-pair on the device, the
authenticator stores a master secret `M` and uses it in combination
with a TRNG to generate new keys and derive previous keys. A 
random number `CTX` is generated, and placed in the `CREDENTIAL ID`
parameter. The Relying Party stores the `CREDENTIAL ID` after
the registration process and will issue it back to the
authenticator for subsequent authentications.

#### Registration

1. Generate `CTX` and derive a sub-key from `M` using `HKDF(CTX, M)`
2. Create a new key-pair `(pub, priv)` from the generated sub-key
3. Return the `CTX` and the public key `pub` to the Relying Party
4. The Relying Party stores `CTX` and `pub`

#### Authentication

1. The Relying Party issues a authentication request using `CTX`
2. The authenticator derives the key pair from `CTX` as stated above
3. Proceede normally as if `priv` was loaded from memory

> __TODO:__ Also MAC the CTX to ensure its integrity.
